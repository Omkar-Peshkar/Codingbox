       Q40 wap Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is Ai
          . She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has
            the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest
            contiguous arithmetic subarray.
          Input
               The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
               Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
              contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai

          Output
          For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
          number (starting from 1) and y is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic
          subarray.
       Q41 wap Problem Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive
           days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi

           . A day is record breaking if it

           satisfies both of the following conditions:
            ● The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of
            visitors on each of the previous days.
            ● Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger
            than the number of visitors on the following day.
            Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
            Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
          Input
               The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
               Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
               contains N integers. The i-th integer is Vi
          .Output
               For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
               number (starting from 1) and y is the number of record breaking days.
        Q42 wap Problem Given an array arr[] of size N. The task is to find the first repeating element in an
            array of integers, i.e., an element that occurs more than once and whose index of
            first occurrence is smallest.
            Constraints
            1 <= N <= 106
            0 <= Ai <= 106
        Q43 wap Problem Given an unsorted array A of size N of non-negative integers, find a continuous

            1 <= N <= 105
            0 <= Ai <= 1010
